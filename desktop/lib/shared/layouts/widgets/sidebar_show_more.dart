/// One number for both of them — the project list, and the chats inside a
/// project — so those two can't grow differently-sized pages. The loose chats
/// are the exception and page at [kSidebarChatsFirstPage]; see there for why

/// already see, so cutting that list short costs you nothing you can't find;
/// a chat that belongs to no project is in this list or nowhere. Opening it at
/// five made "Show more" the row a person clicked most.
///
/// It doubles as the threshold, which is the point of stating it as the first

/// five at a time makes them click four times to reach a chat from last week.
/// Whoever asked has already told you they want a longer list.
///
/// One step for every section, including the one that opens at
