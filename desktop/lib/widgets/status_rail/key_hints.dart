/// The keys that mean something RIGHT NOW, along the bottom of the window.
///
/// ⌘/ already prints every shortcut this app has, and it is the wrong shape for
/// the problem it was given: a modal is something you go and look up, so it
/// teaches only the people who already suspect there is something to learn. The
/// keys nobody discovers are the ones nobody goes looking for.
///
/// zellij answers this with a strip along the bottom that changes with the mode,
/// and vim users answer it with which-key. Both work for the same reason — the
/// hint is in the corner of the eye during the work, not behind a gesture — and
/// both are read hundreds of times before they stop being read at all, which is
/// the mark of a good one: it teaches itself out of a job.
///
/// IT CHANGES WITH WHERE THE KEYBOARD IS, and that is most of its value. With
/// the cursor in the rail, `j` and `k` are live and plain — the one surface in
/// this app where an unmodified letter does something — and nothing else on
/// screen says so. A strip that printed the same six chords in both states
/// would be decoration.
///
/// It rides the strip that was already there rather than adding a second one.
/// That strip carries two usage figures and has the whole width to itself; a
/// row of hints costs no height and gives the surface a second reason to exist.
